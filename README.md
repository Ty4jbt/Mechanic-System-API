# Auto Repair Shop API: Inventory Management Implementation

## Overview

This document explains the changes made to implement the inventory management system for the auto repair shop API. Instead of creating a new inventory model from scratch, I've enhanced the existing parts system to function as inventory, renamed components for clarity, and added new functionality to track costs and quantities.

## Key Changes

### 1. Model Updates

- Renamed `Part` model to `Inventory` with enhanced fields:
  - Added `quantity_in_stock` to track available inventory
  - Renamed relationship fields for clarity
  - Added `total_cost` fields to `ServiceTicket` and `Order` models

- Updated junction tables:
  - Renamed `service_part` to `service_inventory`
  - Renamed `OrderParts` to `OrderItems`
  - Renamed `ServicePartQuantity` to `ServiceInventoryQuantity`

### 2. Blueprint Reorganization

- Renamed `parts_bp` to `inventory_bp` with URL prefix `/inventory`
- Updated schemas to reflect model changes
- Added comprehensive inventory management routes
- Maintained backward compatibility where possible

### 3. New Receipt Functionality

- Added receipt generation to both service tickets and orders
- Receipts include:
  - List of items with quantities and prices
  - Per-item costs
  - Total cost
  - Associated order or service ticket information

### 4. Inventory Operations

- Added stock tracking for inventory items
- Implemented stock reduction when items are added to service tickets
- Implemented stock increase when orders are placed
- Added validation to prevent stock depletion

### Adding Inventory to a Service Ticket

```http
POST /service_tickets/1/inventory
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "inventory_ids": [1, 2, 3],
  "quantities": [2, 1, 4]
}
```

This will:
1. Add the specified inventory items to the service ticket
2. Adjust inventory stock levels
3. Calculate costs
4. Return a receipt

### Retrieving a Service Ticket Receipt

```http
GET /service_tickets/1/receipt
```

Returns a detailed receipt with all items, quantities, and costs.

### Creating an Order to Restock Inventory

```http
POST /orders/
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "mechanic_id": 1,
  "inventory_items": [
    {
      "inventory_id": 1,
      "quantity": 10
    },
    {
      "inventory_id": 2,
      "quantity": 5
    }
  ]
}
```

This will:
1. Create a new order
2. Increase inventory stock levels
3. Calculate total cost
4. Return a receipt

## Data Integrity Considerations

- The migration preserves existing relationships between parts and service tickets
- Cost fields are calculated during migration and maintained on updates
- Inventory quantities are validated to prevent negative stock
- Relationships are properly maintained between inventory items, service tickets, and orders

## Next Steps

1. Test the migration process thoroughly before executing in production
2. Consider adding inventory analytics (low stock alerts, usage trends)
3. Implement inventory search and filtering features
4. Add inventory reporting capabilities
